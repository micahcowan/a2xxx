An educational experiment regarding live-drawn versus page-swapped text on the Apple ][, comparing display toggles with the firmware's standard output routine, direct screen writes, and text page-flipping.

Download the disk image from the [Releases](https://github.com/micahcowan/a2xxx/releases) page. Running in an emulator is not recommended, unless that emulator is very accurate when it comes to the timing of screen refresh (for some interesting effects).
