240 REM HOW TO HOOK
250 REM OUTPUT FILTERS
250 REM INTO YOUR APPLE
260 REM
270 REM IF YOU WERE TO BOOT
280 REM DIRECTLY INTO BASIC
290 REM (NO DOS), AND POKE
300 REM THESE FILTER ROUTINES
310 REM DIRECTLY INTO MEMORY
320 REM AT $030B, THE WAY YOU
330 REM WOULD HOOK THEM INTO
340 REM FILTERING SCREEN
350 REM OUTPUT WOULD BE TO
360 REM SET $36-$37 TO THE
370 REM ADDRESS ($030B, LOW
380 REM BYTE FIRST).
390 REM
400 REM HOWEVER, BOTH DOS AND
410 REM PRODOS HAVE ALREADY
420 REM HOOKED THIS FOR THEIR
430 REM OWN PURPOSES, AND
440 REM TAKE MEASURES TO KEEP
450 REM IT THAT WAY, SO BOTH
460 REM DOS'S NEED OTHER
470 REM MEANS OF HOOKING IN.
480 REM
490 REM PRODOS HAS EXPLICIT
500 REM SUPPORT FOR DOING
510 REM THIS ON THE COMMAND
520 REM LINE: ] PR#A$30B
530 REM
540 REM I'D HAVE PREFERRED TO
550 REM USE THIS METHOD, BUT
560 REM DO NOT HAVE
570 REM CONVENIENT TOOLS FOR
580 REM BUILDING PRODOS
590 REM IMAGES OUTSIDE OF A
600 REM RUNNING APPLE2. SO
610 REM I'M USING WHAT WORKS
620 REM FOR AT LEAST MY
630 REM VERSION OF APPLE DOS
640 REM (UNSURE IF A BETTER
650 REM MEANS EXISTS): TO SET
660 REM $AA53-54 TO THE
670 REM DESIRED ADDRESS.
680 REM SO WE DO THAT.
